# Kaichou Graduation Project

The Kaichou Project is a graduation tribute website for the VTuber [Kiryu Coco](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS9uQI-jC3DE0L4IpXyvr6w).

## Setup

To set up and run the project you will need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (at least version 12) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

First run `yarn install` and wait for the dependencies to finish installing.

Next, copy and rename the `.env.example` files in both front- and backend to `.env`. Do not delete the `.env.example`.

Lastly you should be able to start the project by simply running `yarn dev`.

To get linting to work in your IDE of choice (for example VSCode), install the [prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) plugins.

## Project Structure

The project is currently split into a frontend and backend package, both being tied together in the project root using [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

Both frontend and backend are using [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) for type safety.

### Frontend

The frontend uses nextjs, which makes [routing pretty simple](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction). There is a `components` folder for anything that isn't supposed to show up on the actual website.

Use the `public` folder for images and assets.

For styling there is [scss with css modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support), so do not ever put any css inline unless absolutely required.

Also for styling there is the `variables.scss` which is to be used for global variables like colors and mixins.
The `globals.scss` is mainly used for standardization and should rarely be touched at all.

### Backend

The backend uses [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as server for hosting a REST API, which is all set up inside the `src/index.ts`.
Backend also uses several other library:

- [Mongoose](https://expressjs.com/) as ODM for Mongo DB
- [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) as enabler for CORS requests
- [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) and [winston](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) for logging any activity that happens inside the backend service

#### Backend Folder Structure

```
backend
├───src
    ├───config
    ├───constant
    ├───controllers
    ├───middlewares
    ├───models
    │   └───schemas
    ├───services
    ├───utils
    ├───db.ts
    ├───index.ts
    ├───logger.ts
    └───route.ts
├───.env.example
├───package.json
└───tsconfig.json
```

Folders and files explanation:

- `src` => stores all backend files
- `index.ts` => entry point to backend
- `logger.ts` => file for logger
- `route.ts` => place all routes here
- `db.ts` => file for MongoDB connection
- `config` => store any shared config across backend here
- `controllers` => place where you write handlers for routes
- `middleware` => folder for middlewares
- `models` => folder for MongoDB models
- `schemas` => folder for MongoDB schemas
- `services` => where you store any logic code related to data processing before it is saved or fetched to DB
- `utils` => folder for util functions

#### Logs

After you start the backend server, a folder will be created automatically, named the `logs` folder. There are 5 log files that will be created and updated as the server runs, here is the actual place where any activity logs on the backend will be recorded.

#### ENV Variables

Env variable names inside `package/backend/.env.example` should be self explanatory. Here is more explanation of them:

- `PORT` => Backend service port
- `DEBUG` => Set to `TRUE` if you want debug messages to show, ideally in dev you set this to `TRUE` and to `FALSE` in production
- `CLIENT_URL` => frontend's URL
- `DB_URI` => mongodb connection string, [you can find the details for it here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/connection-string/)
- `CAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY` => secret key for Google ReCaptcha, [you can create one in here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create). Choose reCAPTCHA type v3 when creating it

For frontend, Env variable can be found in `package/frontend/.env.example`, which includes:

- `PORT` => Frontend service port
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` => URL for backend
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` => site key for Google ReCaptcha, [you can create one in here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create). Choose reCAPTCHA type v3 when creating it
